# SESSION 4 – APPLE MOTOR CONTROL

# Sample robot motor data
distance = 10   # meters
time = 2        # seconds

# Speed calculation
speed = distance / time

print("Distance:", distance, "m")
print("Time:", time, "sec")
print("Motor Speed:", speed, "m/s")
OUTPUT:
Distance: 10 m
Time: 2 sec
Motor Speed: 5.0 m/s
